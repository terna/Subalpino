\begin{frame}{Descrizione}

\begin{itemize}

\item
Un modello microfondato con agenti che interagiscono, seguendo regole comportamentali plausibili in un mondo dove l'epidemia di Covid-19 sta influenzando le azioni di tutti. 
\item
Il modello opera con: 

\begin{enumerate}[i]
\item agenti infetti classificati come sintomatici o asintomatici e 
\item ta luoghi di contagio specificati in modo dettagliato, grazie alle capacità di modellizazione basata sugli agenti. 
\end{enumerate}

 \item
The \textcolor{red}{infection transmission} is related to three factors: the infected person's characteristics and those of the susceptible one, plus those of the space in which a contact occurs.

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{~}

\begin{itemize}
\item
The micro-based structure of the model allows factual, counterfactual, and conditional simulations to investigate both the spontaneous or controlled development of the epidemic. Examples of counterfactual situations are those considering:

\begin{enumerate}[i]
\item different timing in the adoption of the non-pharmaceutical containment measures;
\item  alternative strategies focusing exclusively on the defense of fragile people.
\end{enumerate}

\item
The model generates complex epidemic dynamics, emerging from the consequences of agents' actions and interactions, with high variability in outcomes, but frequently with a stunning realistic reproduction of the  contagion waves that occurred in the reference region. 

\item
We take charge of the variability of the epidemic paths within the simulation, running batches of executions with 10,000 occurrences for each experiment.

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{~}

\begin{itemize}

\item The \textcolor{red}{AI and inverse generative sides of the model} come from constructing a meta-agent optimizing the vaccine distribution among people groups---characterized by age, fragility, work conditions---to minimize the number of symptomatic people (deceased persons come from there).

\item We can characterize the action of the planner both:
\begin{enumerate}[i]
\item introducing ex-ante rules following ``plain'' or ``wise'' strategies that we imagine as observers or
\item \textcolor{red}{evolving those strategies via the application of a genetic algorithm}. 
\end{enumerate}

\item The genome is a matrix of vaccination quotas by people groups, with their time range of adoption. 

\end{itemize}


\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{The model}

\begin{itemize}
 
 \item
As the agents can be Susceptible, Infected, symptomatic, asymptomatic, and Recovered, the name of the model is S.I.s.a.R., with the capital letters recalling the S.I.R. scheme.

\item 
We use NetLogo (\href{https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/}{https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/}).

\item
S.I.s.a.R. is at \href{https://terna.to.it/simul/SIsaR.html}{https://terna.to.it/simul/SIsaR.html} with information on model construction, and an online executable version.

\item
 A paper is published at \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.08885}{https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.08885}

\item 
The model includes the structural data of Piedmont, an Italian region, but we can easily calibrate it for other areas. The simulation reproduces a realistic calendar (e.g., national or local government decisions) via a dedicated script interpreter.

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Contagion representation}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Contagion representation}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
The model allows analyzing the sequences of contagions in simulated epidemics, reporting the places where the contagion occur. 
  \item
We represent:
\begin{enumerate}[i] 
\item
each infected agent as a horizontal segment (from the starting date to the final date of the infection) with vertical connections to other agents if they receive the disease from the specifically represented agent; 
\item
the new infected agents via further segments at an upper level. 
\end{enumerate}

  \item
With colors, line thickness, and styles, we display multiple information. 

  \item
This enables understanding at a glance how an epidemic episode is developing. In this way, it is easier to reason about countermeasures and, thus, to develop intervention policies.

  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Exploring cases}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Simulation batches}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item

We explore systematically the introduction of factual, counterfactual, and prospective interventions to control the spread of the contagions. 

  \item
Each simulation run---whose length corresponds to the disappearance of symptomatic or asymptomatic contagion cases---is a datum in a wide scenario of variability in time and effects.   
  
  \item
We need to represent compactly the results  emerging from batches of simulation repetitions, to compare the  consequences of the basic assumptions adopted for each specific batch.

 \item
Besides summarizing the results with the usual statistical indicators, we adopt the technique of the heat-maps.

\item
Each heat-map reports the duration of each simulated epidemic in the $x$ axis and the number of the symptomatic, asymptomatic, and deceased agents in the $y$ axis. The $z$ axis is represented by the colors, as in the logarithmic scale on the right of each picture. 

\item
In our batches we have 10,000 runs.

\end{itemize}

 repository \href{https://github.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19}{https://github.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19}.
 
 \item In the first wave we had uniquely data about symptomatic infected people, but from October 2020 data are mixed.
 
 \item In the above \emph{git}  repository, in October and November 2020 we had ``Positive cases emerged from clinical activity'', unfortunately then reported as ``No longer populated'' (from the end of November 2020, my observation) and ``Positive cases emerging from surveys and tests, planned at national or regional level'', again ``No longer populated'' (from the end of November, my observation).
 
 \item Using those two series, it was possible to estimate a subdivision between symptomatic and asymptomatic cases, which is no longer possible.

\section{Planning vaccination campaigns}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Introduction}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Genetic Algorithms (GAs) and how to use them our case}


\begin{itemize}

\item An introduction to genetic algorithms (GAs) is at \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm}{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic\_algorithm}, with the related Holland's schema theorem at \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holland's_schema_theorem}{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holland's\_schema\_theorem}.


\item Exploring vaccination sequences, using \emph{genetic algorithms}: a detailed note is at \href{https://terna.to.it/simul/GAresultPresentation.pdf}{https://terna.to.it/simul/GAresultPresentation.pdf} and the analysis is in Section 7 of the paper at \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.08885}{https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.08885}.

\item In our case we have to decide how to assign vaccinations over time to seven groups of persons.

\item We evolve populations of models whose parameters correspond to their genome. We create newer and newer populations, randomly extracting models using a roulette having the dimension of the pockets proportional to the fitness. After extraction, we cross the genomes with random copy errors, and so on. Fitness is the total number of symptomatic people (death people come from there) with the minimum value as the goal.

\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{2021: planning a vaccination campaign using GAs, with non-pharmaceutical containment measures in action, but {\color{red} without the inclusion of the new external input, i.e., the Omicron variant}}

\begin{itemize}

\item We compare the effect of choosing the vaccination quotas via GAs with two predetermined strategies, considering three hypotheses (vaccinated people: still spread the contagion; do not spread the contagion; do it in the 50\% of the case); we show here only the first case results.

\item Key dates: 
\begin{itemize}
\item in the internal calendar of the model, day 373 is Feb. \nth{12}, 2021, which is effectively the starting point of the vaccinations in the region; 

\item the day of the effectiveness of the initial vaccinations, 40 days later, is day 413 (Mar. \nth{22}, 2021).
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Vaccination groups}

We take into consideration seven groups in order of decreasing fragility but also considering the exposure to contagion:

\begin{enumerate}
\item [\emph{g1}]
	extra fragile people with three components;
	\begin{itemize}
		\item due to intrinsic characteristics: people in nursing homes;
		\item due to risk exposure:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item nursing homes operators;
			\item healthcare operators;
 		\end{itemize} 
 	\end{itemize}  
\item [\emph{g2}]
	teachers;
\item [\emph{g3}]
	workers with medical fragility;
\item [\emph{g4}]
	regular workers;
\item [\emph{g5}]
	fragile people without special characteristics;
\item [\emph{g6}]
	regular people, not young, not worker, and not teacher;
\item [\emph{g7}]
	young people excluding special activity cases (a limited number in \emph{g1}).
\end{enumerate}
